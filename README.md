# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Project Detials
The goal of the project was to refact a website making it more accesable and logical. 
While keeping the functinality of the code I cleaned up both the HTMl and CSS to make it more comprehensable and digestable.

# Why
To learn how to make a website that not only works but is able to be understood vclearly by any who look at the soucre code.
This was to teach how just functionality can make something clunking and confusing and not always get all the content across as demonstrated by the images not having alt tags therefore if someone has slow internet they would be missing content.

# Problems Solved
The Site is now more accesable to more users and descriptive on what is going on. All of the links now correctly work to allow for easy page navigation.
On the devloper side the Html is no longer just seperated by div tags as well as the CSS lost its redundaunt parts 
-The header has its own section with navigation inside. 
-The next section is the large image with has a descriptive alt
-Next is the main content that is broken into thre subsections to explain three different services with imgs and paragraphs
-The aside tag seprates from the main content and provides additional info on the side
-Footer is broken into its own section
-CSS is condensed and reduandant code removed such as the repeated h2 tags being combined into one h2 section
-Orginized to match with order appearing upon page
-Both the HTMl and CSS are commented to provide anyone viewing complete understanding of every aspect of the code.

# Takaways
I learned the importance of Semantic Html and CSS as it clearifies to anyone who has to review or work with your code making collaboration much easier. 
Just functionality could result in code that is diffcult to edit or share therefore adding time to any project with collaboration or even during the revision process as you might forget all that you were thinking and without comments and clear sections you may have to start over.
